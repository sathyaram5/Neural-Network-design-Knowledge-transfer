# Neural-Network-design-Knowledge-transfer
• Neural network model was designed in the motive to enhance or at least stabilize the learning rate for better predictive models using 
model modifier technique called Knowledge transfer, where a system's knowledge is transferred to another model of similar pattern, from
the existing knowledge, rather predicting from scratch.

• Developed an effective ANN model to predict the natural frequency and power of Cantilever beam and Energy harvester through knowledge
transfer technique at the energy harvesting and materials laboratory.


• The model efficiently reduced the relative error for predicting the natural frequencies of the Energy Harvester from 2.27% to
1.56% with the same number of data points. The predicted power was found to be within relative error of 1.5%.
